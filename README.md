## EcoAlert Kerala: AI-Driven Waste Reporting and Eco-Alternative Advisor

### Overview
EcoAlert Kerala is a mobile app concept that empowers citizens to report waste-management issues in real time and receive AI-powered, personalized eco-friendly alternatives. It aligns with Kerala's zero-waste ambitions by bridging the gap between reporting and action using computer vision, geotagging, and AR-based education.

### Problem
Despite ambitious initiatives like "Vr̥ddhi 2025" and high reported waste-free coverage, Kerala continues to face significant waste-management challenges:
- **Unsustainable practices**: offloading non-biodegradable waste to other states
- **Public resistance**: opposition to waste-processing plants, unresolved toxic smoke from improper disposal
- **Environmental vulnerability**: flood-prone and urban areas face amplified harm
- **Low household adoption**: limited awareness and tools to report illegal dumping/overflows
- **Impact hotspots**: backwaters, beaches, and smart cities (e.g., Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi)

### Solution
EcoAlert Kerala enables citizens to:
- Capture photos/videos of waste hotspots (illegal dumps, overflowing bins, hazardous/biomedical waste)
- Automatically geotag and submit reports anonymously or publicly
- Use AI to classify waste type (plastic, organic, hazardous) and receive immediate, localized eco-alternative suggestions
- Visualize sustainable transformations via Augmented Reality (AR) simulations
- Crowd-verify reports and forward validated issues to authorities for faster action

### Key Features
- **Real-Time Reporting**: Upload photos/videos with GPS tagging; generate public heatmaps
- **AI Categorization & Advice**: On-device or cloud AI classifies waste and recommends Kerala-specific alternatives (e.g., home composting with bio-bins, deposit-return schemes for PET)
- **AR Visualization**: Point the camera at waste items to see AR overlays of eco-transformations (e.g., plastic bottle → eco-bag; organics → fertilizer)
- **Community Gamification**: Points for verified reports and adopted alternatives; leaderboards and badges; potential rewards via local eco-groups (e.g., Haritha Karma Sena)
- **Authority Integration**: Automated alerts to government bodies; dashboards for tracking resolution; public progress for trust
- **Educational Resources**: Localized content (Malayalam/English) on zero-waste, flood-resilient handling, and regulations; links to campaigns such as Vr̥ddhi 2025

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Flutter (Android/iOS), AR via ARCore/ARKit plugins or Unity/AR Foundation
- **Backend**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore/RTDB, Cloud Functions, Storage); optional Node.js microservices
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow Lite or PyTorch Mobile for on-device classification; optional cloud inference; lightweight NLP for Q&A
- **Mapping & Geolocation**: Google Maps SDK or OpenStreetMap; heatmap rendering
- **Data Security**: TLS in transit, Firebase Security Rules, anonymized reporting, GDPR-like posture

### High-Level Architecture
1. **Client (Flutter)**
   - Capture media, get location, run on-device waste classifier (TFLite/PyTorch Mobile)
   - Submit report: media → Firebase Storage; metadata → Firestore
   - Receive AI suggestions and AR overlays
   - Community voting and gamification
2. **Cloud Backend (Firebase + Functions)**
   - Media processing (optional cloud vision)
   - Validation pipeline and spam checks
   - Authority notification (email/webhook/API to municipal systems)
   - Heatmap aggregation and analytics
3. **Admin/Authority Dashboard**
   - Report triage, assignment, SLA tracking
   - Public transparency view
4. **AR Content Service**
   - Asset delivery for AR overlays (CDN/Storage)

### Data Flow
1) Capture photo/video → optionally compress locally
2) Collect GPS coordinates → prompt for accuracy confirmation
3) On-device model predicts waste type → generate suggestions
4) Upload media to Storage; write report document to Firestore (minimal PII)
5) Cloud Function triggers: validate, annotate, notify authorities/community
6) Community votes verify legitimacy → escalate or close
7) Heatmaps and dashboards update near real-time

### Privacy & Safety
- Anonymous-by-default reporting with optional profile for gamification
- Strip precise EXIF beyond required geohash accuracy for heatmaps
- Media redaction for faces/plates where feasible
- Role-based access control via Firebase Auth + Security Rules
- Data minimization and media retention policies

### Roadmap (MVP → Pilot)
- **MVP (4–6 weeks)**
  - Flutter app: capture, geotag, submit, view heatmaps
  - Basic TFLite model: plastic vs organic vs hazardous
  - Suggestions catalog (Kerala-specific) and simple AR overlays
  - Firestore schema, Security Rules, Cloud Functions for notifications
  - Community voting and basic leaderboard
- **Pilot (6–10 weeks)**
  - Authority dashboard and SLA tracking
  - Model improvements, dataset collection loop, on-device optimization
  - Advanced AR assets and in-app tutorials
  - Partnerships with Haritha Karma Sena and waste management projects

### Success Metrics
- Validated reports and resolution rate/SLA
- Reduction in repeat incidents at hotspots (heatmap deltas)
- User adoption: DAU/MAU, report conversion, AR engagement
- Adoption of eco-alternatives (e.g., composting, deposit returns)

### License
MIT or similar permissive license (to be decided).
